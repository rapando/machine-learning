    init
        Lists the available files for reading
        Calls the load_data method

    load_data
        Prompts the user to choose the file to read
        Reads the data and saves it to self.data
        It stores the number of samples, attributes of each sample, the high and low states of the data

    validate_data
        returns True if the number of columns of all samples is the same and False if otherwise

    load_sample
        prompts the user to enter the attributes of the sample

    get_differences
        calculates the differences of the sample from the data to get the distance between the sample and each element in the data
        Sorts the distances

    cluster
        uses the sorted data array to find the sample's nearest neighbors by choosing half of the data elements with the least distance from the given sample
